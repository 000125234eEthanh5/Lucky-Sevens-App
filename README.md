This is a terminal based game that simulates a person rolling two dice 100 times. The application counts every time the dice values add up to seven and record that for the end. After 100 simulated rolls, the console will print the line:

```
After 100 rolls, you rollled (however many sevens you rolled) sevens
```
You then press enter, the up key, and enter again to run the program again.
